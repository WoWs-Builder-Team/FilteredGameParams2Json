Laid down by the order of Argentine, this cruiser was put on sale shortly before the conflict in the Far East and offered to Russia, but after the Russian government declined to purchase it, Japan stepped in and quickly bought the Nisshin-to-be cruiser. Capable of running at speeds of up to 20 knots, the ship was protected by a 152 mm armor belt, and carried four 203 mm main guns and fourteen 152 mm guns.\n\nHastily, the still-incomplete cruiser, together with her sister ship, was transferred to Japan. It arrived in February of 1904, during the very first days of the Russo-Japanese War. Two months later, Nisshin participated in combat actions. In January 1905, Takano Isoroku, a young Naval Academy graduate, was assigned to Nisshin to serve as an artillery officer. Later in May that year, the Battle of Tsushima became the first real challenge for the future naval commander.",

 "PCQM086_SWIRSKI_DESCR": "Jerzy Włodzimierz Świrski was born on April 5, 1882, in the town of Kalisz, far from the sea. This region of Poland was part of the Russian Empire at the time, and the future admiral's father had served as a field officer in the Russian army. At first, the young man followed in his father's footsteps and graduated from the 1st Moscow Cadet Corps, but in 1899, he chose a different career path.\n\nŚwirski passed the necessary exams to be enrolled in the senior classes of the Naval Cadet Corps in St. Petersburg—the sole educational institution for training combat officers for the Russian Imperial Navy. Three years later, he received the rank of midshipman and was appointed to the newest light cruiser, Askold. Once on board, he departed for the Far East. But the young officer did not take part in the Russo-Japanese War—in 1903, he caught a serious lung disease, returned to St. Petersburg, and spent the next two years recovering.\n\nJerzy continued his service in the Black Sea Fleet, and in 1905, was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. He completed navigation courses and gradually climbed the ranks, acting as a navigation officer on cruisers, then battleships, then as a navigational flag officer for the navigation section of the destroyer division and battleship brigade. In 1912, Świrski received the rank of senior lieutenant, and just before the outbreak of World War I, he was appointed as chief of navigation branch in the headquarters of the commander of the Black Sea Fleet.\n\nJerzy held this crucial position throughout the war and even beyond, until May 1918. Together with the fleet commanders of the World War I period—Admirals A.A. Eberhard and A.V. Kolchak—Świrski participated in military campaigns and was involved in clashes with German-Turkish forces on the Black Sea. By October 1917, he had received three military orders of the Russian Empire and the rank of naval commander. However, Jerzy Świrski wasn't destined to become an admiral of the Russian Navy.",

 "PCQM090_SWIRSKI_DESCR": "On the eve of World War II, the main fleet of the Polish Navy consisted of four destroyers. Among them were Błyskawica and Grom (built in the U.K. under a special project in 1937)—the most advanced European destroyers of their time. Two more ships of this class were ordered in Poland but were never laid down because of the war. The other two destroyers were Wicher and Burza (built in France and based on the design of the Bourrasque-class destroyers in 1930 and 1932), which were intended to be overhauled in the early 1940s, with their weaponry to be replaced with armament similar to that of Błyskawica.\n\nMinelayer Gryf, built in 1938 in France, was supposed to fulfill the additional functions of a training ship and ceremonial presidential yacht. Finally, the largest ships to be built in Poland were six Jaskółka-class minesweepers.\n\nThey had a total of five submarines, the most up to date of which were the large ocean-going submarines, Orzeł and Sęp, which had been specially designed and built in the Netherlands before being commissioned into the fleet in the spring of 1939. Two enhanced versions of the Orzeł submarines were ordered from France, but the outbreak of war prevented them from being completed. Three mine-laying submarines—Żbik, Ryś, and Wilk—were also built in France between 1931 and 1932.\n\nAs a result of the September 1939 campaign, only five ships of the Polish Navy made it to the United Kingdom to continue the fight. However, of these, destroyer Grom and submarine Orzeł were sunk in 1940, while submarine Wilk was suitable only for training. The remaining destroyers, Burza and Błyskawica, fought for pride and glory. They eventually returned home and became museum ships, Burza first, from 1960–75, then Błyskawica after her.\n\nIn 1940, the Polish Navy was replenished with a British G-class destroyer, Garland, which retained her name, and an N-class destroyer named Piorun. In May 1941, the latter made her mark on history with a dashing night attack on battleship Bismarck. Both ships, like the other British ships, were returned to the U.K. in 1946. A different fate, however, awaited another British ship that hoisted the white-red flag in 1942—an M-class destroyer named Orkan. She was sunk by a German submarine in October 1943, while escorting a convoy in the North Atlantic. Three Hunt-class escort destroyers that were transferred to the Poles between 1941 and 1942—Krakowiak, Kujawiak, and Ślązak—also fulfilled escort duties. Thousands of nautical miles flowed under their sterns as they escorted hundreds of convoys. Kujawiak was destroyed by a mine near Malta in 1942.\n\nThe ships that served the Poles least of all were the largest ones—cruisers Dragon and Conrad. The former, a Danae-class British light cruiser, was handed over in January 1943. She was later badly damaged by a German manned torpedo in July 1944 off the coast of Normandy. She was not sent for repairs, and the Admiralty simply sent a replacement—another ship of the same class. As for the submarine fleet, British U-class submarines Sokół and Dzik, as well as an American S-class lend-lease submarine—Jastrząb—which was sunk in 1942, sailed under the Polish flag.",

 "PCQM089_SWIRSKI_DESCR": "As a result of a quick campaign in 1939, the Polish Navy, which had been defending the nation's coast, was cut off from the rest of the country within just a few hours. But the defenders of the coastal fortifications, built before the war under the leadership of Jerzy Świrski, were among those who managed to hold off the enemy's attack for the longest time in Poland. These were sailors and soldiers under the command of Commander-in-Chief Józef Unrug, who succeeded in holding the line on the Hel Peninsula until October 1.\n\nŚwirski himself, together with the Polish Ministry of Military Affairs, followed the evacuation orders—first leaving Warsaw and then heading southeast. In late September, he crossed the Romanian border.\n\nHowever, in the early days of October 1939, the rear admiral was summoned to Paris by the head of the new Polish government-in-exile by General Władysław Sikorski, and was appointed as chief of the reconstituted Directorate of the Polish Navy. Fluent in foreign languages, and with rich experience in interacting with representatives of the Allied navies during the interwar period, Jerzy Świrski played a crucial role in bringing about the conclusion of the Polish-British naval agreement in November 1939. It enabled the warships of the defeated state to continue to play their part in the war at sea, embedded within the British Royal Navy.\n\nThanks to the efforts of the rear admiral, the Polish ships retained their national distinctions, naval flag, and order of service. Świrski was responsible for recruitment and training, as well as personnel and disciplinary decisions, and he did a great deal to expand the naval presence of the Polish Navy in the West.\n\nHaving received the rank of vice admiral in 1941, the chief of the Directorate of the Navy acted so independently in relation to Sikorski, chief of staff of the Polish forces in the West, that the latter even made an attempt to stand Świrski down. However, the British Admiralty was strongly against such a decision, with no clear option for someone who could replace him as the actual commander of the Polish Navy. For his merits during the war, His Majesty's government rewarded Jerzy Świrski with the Order of the Bath.\n\nAs a result, he remained in this post until the end of World War II and left the service only in 1946, after the official dissolution of the Polish armed forces in the U.K. The vice admiral remained there as an emigrant, having decided not to return to Soviet Poland.\n\nJerzy Włodzimierz Świrski lived in London and was the beneficiary of a life-long pension from the Admiralty. He died there after contracting a serious illness on June 12, 1959, at the age of 77. Two years prior to his death, the Polish government-in-exile had awarded the vice admiral the Great Ribbon of the Order of Poland Reborn—its highest honor.",

As a result of the intensive maneuvering, at some point of the battle the cruiser got a chance to lead the entire squadron for some time. More than once Nisshin found herself under concentrated gun fire from Russian armored cruisers. Three of her four main battery guns were destroyed and about 100 crew members were lost or injured, which made her one of Japan's most battle-scarred ships. Takano Isoroku was also heavily injured in the explosion of the 203 mm gun of the fore end turret.",

In Japan, the medal was established by an Imperial edict on September 17, 1920. However, the allegorical winged figure didn't mean much to the Japanese, so it was replaced with a depiction of a traditional divine symbol of courage.\n\nDuring the war, Takano Isoroku first served as adjutant at Yokosuka Naval Base HQ.

On April 17, Yamamoto gave his last speech, boosting morale of the pilots, before his fatal flight to Bougainville.

The path ahead of him was the only way for an ambitious young man to leave the country, poverty, and a lack of prospects behind.\n\nAt the academy on Etajima island in Hiroshima Bay, only the strongest spirits prevailed. The rigorous discipline imposed on the students worked effectively to unlock the leadership potential of the future admiral. His small stature didn't prevent him from achieving great things in sports and the kendo martial art.

In September 1924, he was transferred to an air group in Kasumigaura. It was the first Japanese aviation school, and had been established in 1922 with assistance from the U.K. Soon, Yamamoto was assigned as senior officer of the school.\n\nThe professional pilots were hostile to the outsider. However, Yamamoto's passion for learning all the secrets of aviation and support of the same inclinations among his subordinates gained him both authority and respect. Some sources state that the future admiral also mastered the art of plane control and flew a few times. Ōnishi Takijirō, the Japanese naval aviation legend, was one of Yamamoto's brothers-in-arms.",

 "PCZC057_YAMAMOTO_KAIGUN_TAISHO_DESCRIPTION": "After becoming the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, Yamamoto started preparing for war, as he realized that a confrontation with the U.S.A. was inevitable. The \"punching fist\" of aircraft carriers—the 1st Air Fleet—was formed. Warships and task forces practiced various tactics and coordinated actions. Yamamoto appointed his most talented officers to the key positions. Thus, Mitsuo Fuchida became the Commander of the Akagi air group and took personal control over the air attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nDespite all assumed measures, Yamamoto knew that Japan had little chance of countering the U.S.A. forces. The Admiral answered the question of the Prime Minister about their prospects in the war: \"In the first six to twelve months of a war with the United States and Great Britain I will run wild and win victory upon victory. But then, if the war continues after that, I have no expectation of success.\"",

Caliber: 8 mm; magazine: 8 rounds; effective firing range: 50 m.\n\nThe original Nambu was the Type A; its upgraded version, Type A Modified, was designed in 1906 and was in production until 1923. In 1909, the Nambu Type A Modified pistol was officially adopted by the Imperial Japanese Navy. In the Navy, this model was known as the \"Army Type\" while in the Army, which never actually adopted it, the model made a name for itself as the \"Navy Type\". Though the pistol was officially adopted, officers had to buy them with their own money.",

In Eastern Europe, World War I ended in May 1918, and German troops had occupied Crimea, with German flags hoisted over the ships moored in Sevastopol.\n\nLike the majority of Black Sea naval officers in the spring of 1918, Świrski was left on the sidelines, with no means to support himself and in territory occupied by the former enemy. The Bolsheviks were not highly regarded by officers of Polish descent. The solution came with the proclamation of the Ukrainian state, headed by Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi. Many retired officers were eager to join the former general of the Russian Imperial Army, Świrski being one of them. In June of the same year, he joined the Ukrainian Navy.\n\nAs an experienced officer, he was appointed to the naval headquarters in Kiev. In September, a state delegation was sent to Berlin to ensure the transfer of warships from the Germans. The delegation included commander Świrski. In mid-October, he very briefly served as deputy minister of naval affairs but resigned soon after.\n\nThe central powers had lost the war over the territories of the crumbling empire that the Rzeczpospolita had been reviving, so as a Pole, there was nothing more for Jerzy Świrski to do in the service of the Ukrainian state.\n\nUntil the spring of 1919, the former commander was in Odessa—a city occupied by the Entente—at the disposal of the Main Polish Military Committee in the East. Świrski headed the League for the Renewal of the Polish Navy, which was gathering and sending seamen of Polish descent to their homeland. In March, the commander of the Polish army in France, Józef Haller, summoned him to Paris as a maritime affairs expert for the Polish delegation at the Congress of Versailles. However, Świrski filed a request to allow him to go to Warsaw to join the Polish Army, which was fighting on all fronts at the time.",

The new Commander-in-Chief hoisted his flag on Nagato, the most powerful ship of the Empire of Japan. Yamamoto was onboard Nagato when he gave his famous order to commence the attack on Pearl Harbor, whereupon he took his ship along with five more battleships to sea, providing remote cover for the First Air Fleet.",

The ship displaced more than 63,000 tons of water, two thirds of which accounted for the weight of its armor protection alone. The battleship's main battery included the most powerful naval guns in the world, namely nine 460 mm guns. Yamamoto, who later flew his flag on both ships during his service at the Navy Ministry, was opposed to the idea of building extremely expensive giants such as Musashi and Yamato, considering such expenditure of resources unreasonable.\n\nIn February 1943, Musashi arrived at the main Japanese Navy base on Truk island. The brand new battleship was specifically equipped to serve as a flagship. Therefore, Yamamoto transferred his flag to Musashi immediately after her arrival. Several weeks later, the Admiral set out on the fateful trip to Rabaul. In May 1943, the ashes of the perished Yamamoto were brought to Japan onboard his final flagship, battleship Musashi.",

Yamato's construction was carried out in absolute secrecy. The battleship started her service in the first weeks of the Pacific War, in December 1941.\n\nIn February 1942, Admiral Yamamoto carried his flag over to Yamato, which was in the final phase of the re-equipment process. For a year, he commanded the Combined Fleet from the largest warship in the world. In late May 1942, a number of Japanese battleships led by Yamato took to the sea in order to provide support for the carrier battle group near Midway. Operation MI ended in the loss of four Japanese aircraft carriers, which marked the end of the victorious offensive of Japan in the Pacific Ocean. It was onboard Yamato that Admiral Yamamoto had to experience the grief of another defeat—the Guadalcanal Campaign—that depleted the Japanese Navy.",

It was founded in 1876 during the first years of Emperor Mutsuhito's reign, when massive reforms were initialized in Japan, and the country's naval force was formed. In 1888, the Imperial Naval Academy was moved to the island of Etajima situated in Hiroshima Bay, where a special building was constructed to accommodate it in 1893.\n\nAlmost without exception, officers of the Imperial Navy passed through the halls of this Academy. On Etajima, during three years of training in a severe and ascetic atmosphere, the samurai spirit of future combat commanders was tempered. Takano Isoroku, who would later become Admiral Yamamoto, studied at the Naval Academy from 1901 till 1904.",

The ship could run at a speed of 28.5 knots, her air group consisted of 60 aircraft in the first years of service. Her artillery armament was as good as the artillery of heavy cruisers and consisted of ten 200 mm guns placed in turrets and casemates.\n\nIn October 1933, Rear Admiral Yamamoto was assigned as a commander of the First Carrier Division, whose most powerful ship at that moment was aircraft carrier Kaga. Gradually grasping all the subtle aspects of naval aviation, the new Commander vigorously took on training the ship crews of his unit trying to raise their combat skills to the highest level possible.",

Following a long overhaul and upgrade, the ship was commissioned by the Japanese Navy in 1907. The ship's displacement was 6,500 tons, the upgraded propulsion let the ship run at a speed of 22.7 knots. The cruiser carried 12 Russian 152 mm guns and English 76 mm guns.\n\nSoya belonged to a training squadron aimed at practical training of future naval officers of the Imperial Navy. Lieutenant Takano served as a training officer on several ships of that squadron from June 1908 till July 1910, first on cruiser Aso (formely Russian Bayan), then on cruiser Soya starting from July 1909. During this period, he happened to participate in the large-scale fleet maneuvers and two long-term foreign voyages when he visited ports in North America, Australia, and Southeast Asia.",

After missing for several millennia, the ship was rediscovered on one of the Frontier worlds in the Jericho Reach. Though clearly a warship, it was put to use as a transport by its new, uncouth masters who failed to recognize its true potential. After undergoing intensive repairs and cleansing its quarters of its previous inhabitants, Ignis Purgatio was eventually returned to Imperial Navy service and, since then, it has become an essential component of Battlefleet Solar. Once again, it acts as a fearsome guard dog for humanity and, by proxy, the Emperor Himself.",

 "PCQM088_SWIRSKI_DESCR": "In 1925, Jerzy Świrski took over as chief of marine operations of the Polish Republic. As such, he became fully responsible for all aspects of the development of the Polish naval forces during the interwar period. Constant financial deficiencies and continuous changes in the views of the role of the fleet held by the military and political leadership of the country made this no easy task.\n\nHowever, Świrski, who was promoted to the rank of rear admiral in 1931, was able to maintain the relative independence of the navy within the armed forces, create a professional naval officer corps, and put many useful measures for the crews' combat training into practice. He was also the one to sign off the contracts for the construction of new warships for the small Polish Navy. The rear admiral spared no efforts in the development of the naval base in the new port city of Gdynia, created in the mid-1920s on the country's 90-mile Baltic coast, in order to construct a coastal defense system on the Hel Peninsula.\n\nIn 1936, Jerzy Świrski was awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta for outstanding services.\n\nDue to the rapid deterioration of the political situation in Europe in the first half of 1939, the command of the Polish Navy—headed by Świrski—carefully examined various potential scenarios for the hostilities and the available options for the navy in those situations. The conclusions of the experienced officer were alarming: since the British and French were refusing to send their ships to the Baltic in the event of a new world war, the Polish fleet would be doomed and quickly destroyed—a force of enemy aircraft could achieve this on its own. Moreover, the Polish Armed Forces held the opinion that the sole task of the navy was to engage in battle with the overwhelming forces of the enemy and perish heroically.\n\nIt was only thanks to the efforts, perseverance and reputation of Rear Admiral Świrski that the authorities agreed on the anticipatory withdrawal of the modern Polish destroyers from the Baltic Sea in the event of war's inevitability. According to the plan, they were to operate on the German sea routes from English ports. In the last days of August 1939, it became explicitly clear that the Germans were ready for their assault. On August 30, a division consisting of destroyers Błyskawica, Grom and Burza received the order to start their journey to the U.K. While giving this order from Warsaw, the chief of the directorate of the Polish Navy had no idea under what circumstances he would next see these ships.",

This caused a conflict with the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff, who based their plan on defense and a decisive battle with battleships as the core of the forces. Yamamoto thought that the only way to win a war with the U.S.A. was to regain the initiative and make a sudden crushing blow to the U.S. fleet.\n\nIn the spring of 1940, he raised the idea of a massive air attack on the U.S. naval base in Pearl Harbor. Further details were elaborated by his staff at the beginning of the following year. In December 1941, the famous assault was carried out. The diplomats were delayed with the transfer of an official note to the U.S. government, which resulted in an attack \"without declaration of war\". This was not what the Admiral had intended. He subsequently openly expressed his discontent about this fact to his colleagues.",

Their name was erased from history. But the fickle whims of the Warp decreed that their vengeful spirits would forever haunt the vessel Ragnarok, whose hull was being constructed in the docks above the planet's surface. The furious spirits invaded the hull and ensured the vessel served none but the Ruinous Powers. To this day, Ragnarok and all aboard it cry, \"Vengeance! Death! Blood for the Blood God!\"",

During preparations for his accession to the throne, an edict was issued that established a commemorative medal for participants of the ceremony. The medal was made of silver. Its obverse side depicted the heraldic sign, crossed branches of a mandarin tree and cherry blossom, and a cloth with congratulatory inscriptions.\n\nAs the new Emperor acceded to the throne, Takano Isoroku, who at that time was studying at the Naval War College, received a commemorative medal and was promoted to lieutenant commander.",

Before getting his first assignment as an officer, he needed to serve on a warship for some time. The future naval commander was commissioned on an armored cruiser, Nisshin, which was part of Admiral Togo's main task force.\n\nYamamoto said the following about his combat debut during the Battle of Tsushima: \"A shell hit the only operational 8-inch cannon with terrible force. The smoke cloud cast a pall over the front of the ship, and I felt that I was trapped within a whirlwind. I was thrown several feet. The range tables disappeared from my neck, and two fingers on my left hand hung loosely by just the skin.\" The future commander-in-chief of the Japanese Navy was lucky: if he had lost three fingers instead two, he would have been dismissed.",

Kitakami was the fourth ship in the series. When commissioned, the ship had a displacement of 5,500 tons, and a speed of more than 35 knots. The ship's primary armament consisted of seven 140 mm guns and four 533 mm twin torpedo tubes.\n\nUpon returning from the U.S.A. where he was a military attaché, in August 1921, Commander Yamamoto was assigned to the recently commissioned light cruiser Kitakami as a senior officer. This talented officer's career quickly progressed, not allowing him to stay in the same position for a long time. And thus in December 1921, just four months later, Yamamoto was appointed an instructor at the Naval War College that he had graduated from a couple of years before.",

As a determined opponent of confrontation with the U.S.A. and alliance with the Third Reich, Vice Admiral Yamamoto, who was Deputy Navy Minister in the late 1930s, was constantly receiving letters with threats, which he was easy-going about. He wrote to his friends: \"They can hurt my body, but they will never sweep me off my feet.\"\n\nOn August 30, 1939, Yamamoto was assigned Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, as he was in the good graces of the Emperor and gained the respect of naval officers. That was the last order of his officer-in-charge, Naval Minister Admiral Yonai who was also against the alliance with Nazi Germany and thought that the assignment would save Yamamoto's life, as he would definitely be murdered by nationalists.",

The commander-in-chief was in the pilot's cabin of bomber No. 323. They were intercepted by 14 U.S. P-38 Lightning fighters in the skies above Bougainville island. A few minutes later, bomber No. 323, riddled with bullets, crashed into the jungle. As the medical examination later showed, the admiral was mortally wounded while the plane was still in the air.",

The enthronement ceremonies were held in November 1928 in Kyoto—the former capital of Japan. As tradition demanded, a medal was established for participants of the celebrations. It was made of silver with its obverse side depicting the Imperial throne surrounded by clouds—a symbol of luck—and encircled by blossoms of cherry and mandarin trees.\n\nIn November 1928, shortly after returning from the U.S.A. where he'd served as a naval attaché for several years, Yamamoto Isoroku, at the rank of captain, was put in command of light cruiser Isuzu. Over time, the talented naval commander won the favor and support of the Emperor, who appreciated Yamamoto's professional competence and strong commitment to his cause.",
