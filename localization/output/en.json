The ship displaced more than 63,000 tons of water, two thirds of which accounted for the weight of its armor protection alone. The battleship's main battery included the most powerful naval guns in the world, namely nine 460 mm guns. Yamamoto, who later flew his flag on both ships during his service at the Navy Ministry, was opposed to the idea of building extremely expensive giants such as Musashi and Yamato, considering such expenditure of resources unreasonable.\n\nIn February 1943, Musashi arrived at the main Japanese Navy base on Truk island. The brand new battleship was specifically equipped to serve as a flagship. Therefore, Yamamoto transferred his flag to Musashi immediately after her arrival. Several weeks later, the Admiral set out on the fateful trip to Rabaul. In May 1943, the ashes of the perished Yamamoto were brought to Japan onboard his final flagship, battleship Musashi.",

As a result of the intensive maneuvering, at some point of the battle the cruiser got a chance to lead the entire squadron for some time. More than once Nisshin found herself under concentrated gun fire from Russian armored cruisers. Three of her four main battery guns were destroyed and about 100 crew members were lost or injured, which made her one of Japan's most battle-scarred ships. Takano Isoroku was also heavily injured in the explosion of the 203 mm gun of the fore end turret.",

This caused a conflict with the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff, who based their plan on defense and a decisive battle with battleships as the core of the forces. Yamamoto thought that the only way to win a war with the U.S.A. was to regain the initiative and make a sudden crushing blow to the U.S. fleet.\n\nIn the spring of 1940, he raised the idea of a massive air attack on the U.S. naval base in Pearl Harbor. Further details were elaborated by his staff at the beginning of the following year. In December 1941, the famous assault was carried out. The diplomats were delayed with the transfer of an official note to the U.S. government, which resulted in an attack \"without declaration of war\". This was not what the Admiral had intended. He subsequently openly expressed his discontent about this fact to his colleagues.",

Despite this, Yamamoto did his best to save the Army troops from the military post on the island. The evacuation in February 1943 was brilliantly planned and performed, and was Yamamoto's swan song. Three \"Tokyo Expresses\" transported more than 10 thousand soldiers under the noses of unsuspecting U.S.A. troops, they didn't even notice that the Japanese troops had left Guadalcanal until it was too late.\n\nOn April 3, 1943, a day before his birthday, Admiral Yamamoto flew to Rabaul to take command of Operation I-Go, a massive aerial counter-offensive on the key points occupied by the U.S.A. On April 17, Yamamoto gave his last speech, boosting morale of the pilots, before his fatal flight to Bougainville. The next day, the aircraft with the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet was shot down by U.S.A. fighters.",

Roosevelt personally ordered Navy command to \"get Yamamoto\".\n\nRear Admiral Mitscher who was commanding air forces on the Solomon Islands assigned the 339th Squadron to the task code-named Vengeance, as only that squadron had P-38G Lightning fighters with sufficient operational range. In a quick air battle above Bougainville, they lost one P-38G and shot down the aircraft with Yamamoto and his staff on board. The Bomber Betty carrying the Admiral was shot down by the fighter No. 147 controlled by First Lieutenant Rex T. Barber.",

Yamato's construction was carried out in absolute secrecy. The battleship started her service in the first weeks of the Pacific War, in December 1941.\n\nIn February 1942, Admiral Yamamoto carried his flag over to Yamato, which was in the final phase of the re-equipment process. For a year, he commanded the Combined Fleet from the largest warship in the world. In late May 1942, a number of Japanese battleships led by Yamato took to the sea in order to provide support for the carrier battle group near Midway. Operation MI ended in the loss of four Japanese aircraft carriers, which marked the end of the victorious offensive of Japan in the Pacific Ocean. It was onboard Yamato that Admiral Yamamoto had to experience the grief of another defeat—the Guadalcanal Campaign—that depleted the Japanese Navy.",

The ship could run at a speed of 28.5 knots, her air group consisted of 60 aircraft in the first years of service. Her artillery armament was as good as the artillery of heavy cruisers and consisted of ten 200 mm guns placed in turrets and casemates.\n\nIn October 1933, Rear Admiral Yamamoto was assigned as a commander of the First Carrier Division, whose most powerful ship at that moment was aircraft carrier Kaga. Gradually grasping all the subtle aspects of naval aviation, the new Commander vigorously took on training the ship crews of his unit trying to raise their combat skills to the highest level possible.",

His motto and throne name throughout his reign was Shōwa, \"Enlightened Harmony.\" Ironically, it was during his reign that Japan was dragged into the bloodiest war in its history. The enthronement ceremonies were held in November 1928 in Kyoto—the former capital of Japan. As tradition demanded, a medal was established for participants of the celebrations. It was made of silver with its obverse side depicting the Imperial throne surrounded by clouds—a symbol of luck—and encircled by blossoms of cherry and mandarin trees.\n\nIn November 1928, shortly after returning from the U.S.A. where he'd served as a naval attaché for several years, Yamamoto Isoroku, at the rank of captain, was put in command of light cruiser Isuzu. Over time, the talented naval commander won the favor and support of the Emperor, who appreciated Yamamoto's professional competence and strong commitment to his cause.",

The air group consisted of 60 aircraft. In her first years of service, the ships artillery included ten 200 mm guns.\n\nAfter a short period commanding the light cruiser Isuzu, in December 1928, Yamamoto Isoroku was assigned to the aircraft carrier Akagi as her commander. At that moment Akagi was the largest ship of her type. Advocating strict discipline, Yamamoto managed to win the respect and affection of the whole crew.",

The new Commander-in-Chief hoisted his flag on Nagato, the most powerful ship of the Empire of Japan. Yamamoto was onboard Nagato when he gave his famous order to commence the attack on Pearl Harbor, whereupon he took his ship along with five more battleships to sea, providing remote cover for the First Air Fleet.",

As a determined opponent of confrontation with the U.S.A. and alliance with the Third Reich, Vice Admiral Yamamoto, who was Deputy Navy Minister in the late 1930s, was constantly receiving letters with threats, which he was easy-going about. He wrote to his friends: \"They can hurt my body, but they will never sweep me off my feet.\"\n\nOn August 30, 1939, Yamamoto was assigned Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, as he was in the good graces of the Emperor and gained the respect of naval officers. That was the last order of his officer-in-charge, Naval Minister Admiral Yonai who was also against the alliance with Nazi Germany and thought that the assignment would save Yamamoto's life, as he would definitely be murdered by nationalists.",

The medal was to be made of bronze and worn on a rainbow suspension ribbon. It was proposed for the obverse side of the medal to depict the figure of the Winged Victory of Samothrace. In Japan, the medal was established by an Imperial edict on September 17, 1920. However, the allegorical winged figure didn't mean much to the Japanese, so it was replaced with a depiction of a traditional divine symbol of courage.\n\nDuring the war, Takano Isoroku first served as adjutant at Yokosuka Naval Base HQ. Later, after graduating from the Naval War College, he was assigned to the 2nd Fleet HQ.",

Though the citizens adhered to the Imperial creed and paid their tithes, secret cabals on the planet's surface worshipped Khorne, the Lord of Rage. These cults were strong. They were hated. They were outnumbered. At the appointed hour, they rose up and tried to overthrow their loyalist masters. They failed. They were defeated in a long, bloody war and all, to a man, perished in flames. Their name was erased from history. But the fickle whims of the Warp decreed that their vengeful spirits would forever haunt the vessel Ragnarok, whose hull was being constructed in the docks above the planet's surface. The furious spirits invaded the hull and ensured the vessel served none but the Ruinous Powers. To this day, Ragnarok and all aboard it cry, \"Vengeance! Death! Blood for the Blood God!\"",

The smoke cloud cast a pall over the front of the ship, and I felt that I was trapped within a whirlwind. I was thrown several feet. The range tables disappeared from my neck, and two fingers on my left hand hung loosely by just the skin.\" The future commander-in-chief of the Japanese Navy was lucky: if he had lost three fingers instead two, he would have been dismissed.",

A legend tells that a golden kite was sent to Emperor Jimmu by the gods to help him defeat his enemies in the final battle for a united Japan. Apart from the kite, the Order features crossed swords and two samurai war shields. 1st Class of the Order: a badge suspended on a wide ribbon in green with a white stripe near the edges, worn on a sash, with a Breast Star worn on the left chest.\n\nYamamoto Isoroku was awarded the highest Class of the Order only after his death in April 1943. By the time the Order was abolished in 1947, only 14 admirals of the Japanese Navy had been awarded the 1st Class. Some of them, like the one conferred to Yamamoto, were awarded posthumously.",

The cruiser carried 12 Russian 152 mm guns and English 76 mm guns.\n\nSoya belonged to a training squadron aimed at practical training of future naval officers of the Imperial Navy. Lieutenant Takano served as a training officer on several ships of that squadron from June 1908 till July 1910, first on cruiser Aso (formely Russian Bayan), then on cruiser Soya starting from July 1909. During this period, he happened to participate in the large-scale fleet maneuvers and two long-term foreign voyages when he visited ports in North America, Australia, and Southeast Asia.",

In 1888, the Imperial Naval Academy was moved to the island of Etajima situated in Hiroshima Bay, where a special building was constructed to accommodate it in 1893.\n\nAlmost without exception, officers of the Imperial Navy passed through the halls of this Academy. On Etajima, during three years of training in a severe and ascetic atmosphere, the samurai spirit of future combat commanders was tempered. Takano Isoroku, who would later become Admiral Yamamoto, studied at the Naval Academy from 1901 till 1904.",

In September 1924, he was transferred to an air group in Kasumigaura. It was the first Japanese aviation school, and had been established in 1922 with assistance from the U.K. Soon, Yamamoto was assigned as senior officer of the school.\n\nThe professional pilots were hostile to the outsider. However, Yamamoto's passion for learning all the secrets of aviation and support of the same inclinations among his subordinates gained him both authority and respect. Some sources state that the future admiral also mastered the art of plane control and flew a few times. Ōnishi Takijirō, the Japanese naval aviation legend, was one of Yamamoto's brothers-in-arms.",

The characteristic features of the kai-gunto, which distinguished it from the shin gunto used by the Imperial Japanese Army, were a brown braided handle and wooden scabbard with a black finish.\n\nYamamoto Isoroku owned several swords made by swordsmiths who used traditional Japanese blacksmithing techniques.

On April 13, the local command sent an encrypted radiogram to the islands with details of the time and place of the arrival of the commander-in-chief, assuming that the Americans would be unable to crack the newly updated code within a few hours.\n\nIn the early morning of April 18, two G4M1 Betty bombers from the 705th Air Group, escorted by six A6M Zero fighters, left Rabaul. The commander-in-chief was in the pilot's cabin of bomber No. 323. They were intercepted by 14 U.S. P-38 Lightning fighters in the skies above Bougainville island. A few minutes later, bomber No. 323, riddled with bullets, crashed into the jungle. As the medical examination later showed, the admiral was mortally wounded while the plane was still in the air.",

The path ahead of him was the only way for an ambitious young man to leave the country, poverty, and a lack of prospects behind.\n\nAt the academy on Etajima island in Hiroshima Bay, only the strongest spirits prevailed. The rigorous discipline imposed on the students worked effectively to unlock the leadership potential of the future admiral. His small stature didn't prevent him from achieving great things in sports and the kendo martial art. His willingness to learn helped Takano Isoroku become one of the academy's best graduates in November 1904.",

Laid down by the order of Argentine, this cruiser was put on sale shortly before the conflict in the Far East and offered to Russia, but after the Russian government declined to purchase it, Japan stepped in and quickly bought the Nisshin-to-be cruiser. Capable of running at speeds of up to 20 knots, the ship was protected by a 152 mm armor belt, and carried four 203 mm main guns and fourteen 152 mm guns.\n\nHastily, the still-incomplete cruiser, together with her sister ship, was transferred to Japan. It arrived in February of 1904, during the very first days of the Russo-Japanese War. Two months later, Nisshin participated in combat actions. In January 1905, Takano Isoroku, a young Naval Academy graduate, was assigned to Nisshin to serve as an artillery officer. Later in May that year, the Battle of Tsushima became the first real challenge for the future naval commander.",

The medal was established on March 31, 1906, by an Imperial Edict in recognition of those who had served in the war that ended with the country emerging as a world power. It was made of gilded bronze and depicted the crossed flags of the Japanese Army and Navy with crest symbols on the obverse side. The medal was worn on a silk ribbon with a bar that had the inscription \"Military Medal of Honor.\" The blue stripe on the ribbon symbolizes Japan's victories during the war at sea.\n\nDuring the Russo-Japanese War, Yamamoto Isoroku, who at that time was known by the name Takano, served on armored cruiser Nisshin. During the Battle of Tsushima, he was seriously wounded, and the would-be naval commander spent several weeks in hospital. Some of the explosion fragments remained in his body for the rest of his life. However, Isoroku's merits didn't go unnoticed. Admiral Tōgō himself promoted him to his first officer rank.",

The ship's primary armament consisted of seven 140 mm guns and four 533 mm twin torpedo tubes.\n\nUpon returning from the U.S.A. where he was a military attaché, in August 1921, Commander Yamamoto was assigned to the recently commissioned light cruiser Kitakami as a senior officer. This talented officer's career quickly progressed, not allowing him to stay in the same position for a long time. And thus in December 1921, just four months later, Yamamoto was appointed an instructor at the Naval War College that he had graduated from a couple of years before.",

In 1909, the Nambu Type A Modified pistol was officially adopted by the Imperial Japanese Navy. In the Navy, this model was known as the \"Army Type\" while in the Army, which never actually adopted it, the model made a name for itself as the \"Navy Type\".

The \"punching fist\" of aircraft carriers—the 1st Air Fleet—was formed. Warships and task forces practiced various tactics and coordinated actions. Yamamoto appointed his most talented officers to the key positions. Thus, Mitsuo Fuchida became the Commander of the Akagi air group and took personal control over the air attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nDespite all assumed measures, Yamamoto knew that Japan had little chance of countering the U.S.A. forces. The Admiral answered the question of the Prime Minister about their prospects in the war: \"In the first six to twelve months of a war with the United States and Great Britain I will run wild and win victory upon victory. But then, if the war continues after that, I have no expectation of success.\"",
